# Concurrent Programming

**Description**

In this section you will learn how to use concurrency in Python, how to speed up your code and which restrictions concurrency has in Python.

**Duration**

40h

**Learning path**

1. Watch the tutorial video from PyCon 2020 about concurrency and parallelism and how you can use it in Python.

Video:

Code repo for materials from the video:

After watching read a summary of this tutorial:

1. Then read more about the difference between concurrency and parallelism. Also, read about how to speed up IO-bound and CPU-bound programs:

1. Another good article about threading. Repeat all concepts which you had knew in previous materials:

You need to know:

- What is concurrency and why do you need it?
- What’s the role of the OS in computing and parallelism?
- How processes work, what fundamental OS structures are used?
- What are threads, how are they created and what’s their scope?
- What modules does Python offer for multithreading and what’s the difference between them? The same for multiprocessing.
- What are race conditions? How to avoid them with synchronization primitives and thread safe collections?
- What is the GIL? In which situations will it affect our code? CPU-bound. IO-bound tasks.
- How to use threading modules in Python: threading, concurrent.futures.
- How to use the multiprocessing module in Python?
- How to use pools with processes and threads in Python? What is the advantage of using pools?
- When to use concurrency in your programs and which module to use?
- A high-level view of what’s happening when you use asyncio.
