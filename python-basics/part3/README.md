**Why do we need to use Python’s standard library?**

The Python Standard Library contains a wide range of modules to deal with everyday programming and is included with the standard version of Python, meaning no additional installation is required. It provides modules for such tasks as interacting with the operating system, processing command line arguments, generating random numbers, and working with dates and time.
