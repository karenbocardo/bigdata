**Why Is Testing Important?**

We all make mistakes and if left unchecked, some of these mistakes can lead to failures or bugs that can be very expensive to recover from. Testing our code helps to catch these mistakes or avoid getting them into production in the first place. Testing therefore is very important in software development. Used effectively, tests help to identify bugs, ensure the quality of the product and to verify that the software does what it is meant to do.

**Learning path**

1. Learn about testing in Python: [https://realpython.com/python-testing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://realpython.com/python-testing/%23more-advanced-testing-scenarios&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1670862656886560&usg=AOvVaw10JBd2KwW2qsoq77TOtRf0) (you can skip paragraph about testing for Web Frameworks). Try to practice with examples from the article in your own environment.

Key concepts which you need to know after reading:

- Difference between manual and automated testing
- Difference between unit testing and integration testing
- Some most used python testing frameworks
- How to write and execute unit tests with ***unittests*** module. Files structure in project folder with tests.
- Fixtures and parametrization
- Single Responsibility Principle, side effects
- Writing Integration Tests and test data-driven applications
1. General techniques to test your CLI apps: [https://realpython.com/python-cli-testing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://realpython.com/python-cli-testing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1670862656887514&usg=AOvVaw1B5t9UlCAid-fepvHKgd3q). After reading you need to know how to use different testing techniques in your work
2. Go deeper in the ***pytest*** framework which you will use in your practice tasks:
- Introduction to pytest. See all videos and repeat code examples from this free mini course : [https://testautomationu.applitools.com/pytest-tutorial/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://testautomationu.applitools.com/pytest-tutorial/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1670862656887930&usg=AOvVaw28JHxwRTmbIgEniOJhLYx-)
- Mocking: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1670862656888221&usg=AOvVaw01L7tUsPPq1l17glOp3-0F)
- How to use Mock in PyTest: [https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-use-mock-in-pytest/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-use-mock-in-pytest/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1670862656888552&usg=AOvVaw1TDvE-U_lxuBKVo5-Mf1eV)

Be familiar with:

**Tasks**

Once you have learned the basics of testing in Python, your next task will be to create tests for tasks from Part 2.
