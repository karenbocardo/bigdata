# Introduction to Big Data Modeling and Management

- goal of **data modeling**: explore the nature of data to figure out storage and proccesing
- goal of **data management**: figure out infrastructure support

## Why Big Data Modeling and Management?

### Summary of Introduction to Big Data

### Big Data Management "Must-Ask Questions"

what is data management? must-ask questions about a data application, that range from how we get the data to how we work with it and how we secure it from malicious users

- [how do we ingest the data?](#data-ingestion)
- where and how do we store it?
- how can we ensure data quality?
- what operations do we perform on data?
- how can these operations be efficient?
- how do we scale up data volume, variety, velocity and access?
- how to keep the data secure?

### data ingestion

**ingestion**: process of getting the data into the data system that we are building or using

large scale systems need more automation and it becomes a part of the big data management infrastructure, so here are questions to ask when automating data ingestion:
- how many data sources?
- how large are data items?
- will the number of data sources grow?
- rate of data ingestion?
- what to do with bad data?
- what to do when data id too little or too much?
