### introduction

data models describe data characteristics
  
data model components:
1. [structure](#data-model-structures): insight into the organization of the data in the file of the data model
2. [operations](#data-model-operations): ability to perform operations, eg. arithmetic operations to integers
3. [constraints](#data-model-constraints): detect the specifications of data values

### data model structures

1. structured data:
   - pattern within data organization
   - uniformit
   - collection of k fields
   - files generated by a similar organizational structure have the same data model
2. unstructured:
   - impossible to know how data is organized or
   - how to identify subparts of it
   - some unstructured data can be compressed data like JPEG images, MP3 audio files, MPEG3 video files and encrypted data
   
### data model operations

data model operations are a set of operations that can be performed on the data. they specify the methods to manipulate the data. 

some types of operations are performed across all data models:
- subsetting (also called selection or filtering, depending on context): extract a part of a collection based on a condition
- substructure extraction: retrieving a part of a structure that is specified
