## data models

### introduction

data models describe data characteristics
  
data model components:
1. [structure](#data-model-structures): insight into the organization of the data in the file of the data model
2. [operations](#data-model-operations): ability to perform operations, eg. arithmetic operations to integers
3. [constraints](#data-model-constraints): detect the specifications of data values

### data model structures

1. structured data:
   - pattern within data organization
   - uniformit
   - collection of k fields
   - files generated by a similar organizational structure have the same data model
2. unstructured:
   - impossible to know how data is organized or
   - how to identify subparts of it
   - some unstructured data can be compressed data like JPEG images, MP3 audio files, MPEG3 video files and encrypted data
   
### data model operations

data model operations are a set of operations that can be performed on the data. they specify the methods to manipulate the data. 

some types of operations are performed across all data models:
- subsetting (also called selection or filtering, depending on context): extract a part of a collection based on a condition
- substructure extraction (projection): retrieving a part of a structure that is specified
- union: combining two collections into a new one with elements of both: there are versions where duplicates are not allowed
- join: combining two collections that have different data content but have common elements

### data model constraints

constaints are logical statements that must hold for data; they are part of data models because they can specify something about the semantics (the meaning of data)

examples
- a week has seven and only seven days
- a movie has only one title (here, the number of titles for a movie is restricted to one)

types:
- value constraint: logical statement about data values (eg. age is never negative); this value constraints (because they restrict the value of some data property)
  - type constraint: restrict types (eg. last name alphabetical)
  - domain constraint: possible set of values allowed for attribute (eg. day between 1 and 31, month 1 to twelve, or january to december)
  - structural
- uniqueness constraint (one title per movie)
- cardinality constraint: check wether it lows between an upper and lower bound (person cat take 0 and 3 blood pressure medications at a time)
- structural constraints: puts restriction on the structure of the data rather than the data value themselves (eg. matrix has to be sqaured, that is, same number of rows and columns)

## different kinds of data models (part 1)

### relational data model

> slides [here](slides/02_RelationalDataModels.pdf)

relational data:
- one of the simplest and most frequently used data models today
- forms the basis of many other traditional database management systems
- the primary data structure is a **table**
  - careful about relational tables (relations)
  - each table it represents a set of tuples
  - **relational tuples** are rows in the table (a record)
    - they imply that unless otherwise stated, the elements of it are **atomic** (they represent on unit of information and cannot be decomposed further)

- remember the definition of **set**: a colecction of distinct elements of the same type 
  - no duplicates
  - dissimilar tuples disallowed

- attention to the first row of the table (the **scheme**):
  - schema parts
    - name of the table: employee
    - attributes
      - ID: int (primary key) 
      - fname: string (not null)
      - lname: string (not null)
      - department: enum(HR, IT, Reasearch, Business)
      - title: string
      - salary: int (>25000)
  - it can also specify constraints (the ones inside parenthesis)
- **foreign keys**: references an attribute from parent table, the values in this column can exist only if the same values in the table being referenced exist
  - (see slides for example) EmpSalaries.EmpID references Employees.ID: in the terminology of the relational model, the EmpID column of EmpSalaries table is called a foreign key that refers to the primary key of the Employees table
- joining relations (see join example of **natural join** in slides): common column is represented once in new table
  - joins are one of the most expensive (time and space consuming operations)
  - for analytical big data application that needs joins, it's very important to choose a suitable data management platform that makes this operation efficient

### semistrictured data mdoel

> slides [here](slides/03_SemistructuredDataModel.pdf)

common types:
- web pages, html
  - a block is nested within a larger block
  - have some structure but are more flexible (can have multiple paragraphs, multiple listed items)
- xml (extensible markup language): standard to represent data
- json
  - nested structure, lists of lists of tuples that are key-value pairs (property and value)

generalize all these different forms of semistructured data modeling them as trees (see slides for conversion). **tree data structure**:
- trees are a well known data structure that allows **navigational access to data**
