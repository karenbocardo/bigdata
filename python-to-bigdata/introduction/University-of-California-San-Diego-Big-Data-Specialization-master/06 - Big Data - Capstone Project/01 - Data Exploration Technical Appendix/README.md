# Data Exploration Technical Appendix

In this short Peer Review assignment, you will be guided in writing the portion of the final project technical appendix that records your actions and key findings from your data exploration phase.

The goal of the technical appendix is to serve as notes on what analysis you did and key findings you made. The appendix would be provided to high-level officers at Eglence, Inc. to accompany a short presentation and provide them a location to look for a bit more detail.

For this short section of the appendix you should document the data sets you had to work with and the basics of the initial exploratory analysis you did. Download and fill in this template (the attached Word file below)which asks you to:

- Provide a quick review of the data files available for analysis (Yes, we know that this information was provided to you in this reading, but it would be critical for one to provide in such a report. You should copy information over and, if needed, re-phrase or summarize).
- Report on your key findings from your aggregation analysis.
- Report on your key findings from your filtering analysis.
