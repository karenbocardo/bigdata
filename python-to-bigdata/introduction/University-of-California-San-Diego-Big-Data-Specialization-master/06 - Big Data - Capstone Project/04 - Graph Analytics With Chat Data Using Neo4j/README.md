# Graph Analytics With Chat Data Using Neo4j

In this short peer review assignment you will be guided in performing some analysis on graph networks of simulated chat data related to the fictitious "Catch the Pink Flamingos" game. The results of your analyses will be included in the technical appendix of the final capstone report, and also submitted here for review.

The goal of the technical appendix is to serve as notes on what analysis you did and key findings you made. The appendix would be provided to high-level officers at Eglence, Inc. to accompany a short presentation and provide them a location to look for a bit more detail.
