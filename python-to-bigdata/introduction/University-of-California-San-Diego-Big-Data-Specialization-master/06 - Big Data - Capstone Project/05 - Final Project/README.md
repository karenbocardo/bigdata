# Final Project

Your project should be submitted in 2 parts.

1. **Final project presentation with accompanying scripts.** Use one of these templates (googlePresentation, PPT) and edit/complete slides 1-7. See suggested directions in the comment field. Additionally, write a slide-by-slide script of the words you would say in a presentation of these slides. You will need to upload a single PDF file with the slide image and the words of the script for that specific slide all on one page. This can be done in one of two ways: either by using PPT and printing "slides with notes" to PDF (though watch if you go over one page), or by creating a document (in whatever software you like -- but probably a word or googledoc), with an image of a slide and the text of the script for that slide, one slide per page. Recall that your entire script should be readable in < 10 minutes.
2. **Technical appendix.** Copy and paste all of your technical appendix submissions together into one file (or use this file (word) and fill in/copy in your responses). Save to PDF and upload.
