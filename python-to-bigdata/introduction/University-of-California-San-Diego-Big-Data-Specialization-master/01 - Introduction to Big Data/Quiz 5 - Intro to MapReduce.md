- Pig, for real-time and in-memory processing of big data.
- Zookeeper, analyze social graphs.
- **Zookeeper, management system for animal named related components**

### 9. What is the difference between low level interfaces and high level interfaces?

- **Low level deals with storage and scheduling while high level deals with interactivity.**
- Low level deals with interactivity while high level deals with storage and scheduling.
